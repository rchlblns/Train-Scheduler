# TRAIN SCHEDULER

Created during Week 7 of UT Austin's Houston Coding Bootcamp. This application provdies up to date arrival and departure information on various trains.

View the finished application [here](https://rchlblns.github.io/Train-Scheduler/)

## Built With
* HTML5
* CSS3
* [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* Javascript
* [jQuery Library](https://jquery.com/)
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
* Firebase
* [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)

## Known Issues/Future Versions
Currently there is an issue with the mobile responsivness of the table on some devices. Additionally, form validation does not work. In future versions of this application, I plan to address these issues as well as adding real-time updates to the "minutes to arrival" and "next train time" columns without having to manually refresh the page. I would also like to incorporate authentication so that only logged in users can make updates to the site.
